## Trending Movies Section

The first section of the website is dedicated to showcasing trending movies. Each movie is presented in a card format, and when you click on a movie card, a modal window opens up, providing you with more information about the movie.

### Modal Details

Inside the modal, you'll find:

- **Movie Description:** A detailed overview of the movie's plot, characters, and setting.
- **Cast Information:** Photos and names of the cast members, presented in cards.
  - The cast cards are in autoplay mode, and they pause when the mouse cursor hovers over them.
- **Trailer Link:** A link to the official movie trailer on YouTube, so you can watch a preview.

## Infinite Scroll

The website also features an infinite scroll functionality. As you scroll down the page, more trending movies will be automatically loaded, allowing you to discover a wide variety of movies without the need to click through multiple pages.

## Genre-based Selection

On the same page, you'll find dedicated sections for both movies and TV series, allowing you to explore content based on different genres. These sections enable you to select content from various genres and even combine multiple genres to find the perfect movies and TV shows that match your preferences.

## Search Section

The website also includes a powerful search feature. In the search section, you can easily find movies and TV series by typing in keywords. The search results will provide you with a list of relevant content, helping you discover your favorite shows and movies quickly.
